  <h1>Tennis: From Scottish Roots to Global Equality</h1>

<p class="green-text">
  Tennis has a very long and interesting history in Scotland. For example, the Great Hall at Stirling Castle and Falkland Palace had tennis courts back in the 16th century. In the nineteenth century, tennis was a fairly exclusive sport, with high level participation being mainly by the upper classes. Scotland produced two Wimbledon men's champions in this period, Herbert Lawford and Harold Mahony.
